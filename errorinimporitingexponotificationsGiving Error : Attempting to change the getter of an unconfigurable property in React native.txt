WHAT HAPPEN AND HOW I  FIXED ABOVE ERROR. the above error can occur in any package paschal, the real reason is 
the packages dependencies issues, there is no way to fix this until someone suggest sth to do, first he need me to
run 'expo-doctor --check' to check expo packages conflict and im my case the expo notification required by expo is
"0.20.1" for me i have '0.18.*' and when i do 'expo-doctor --check' i see a bunch of package whch have the dependencies 
issues and then recommend me to run 'expo-doctor --fix' to fix all packages issues but i've notice its not okay to run
'expo-doctor --fix' you just focus on the package which does not work for you and try to fix it .. for example in my
case i should only install expo-notofication of version 0.20.1 just that after doing that run install pods and here you go
